We do  Naive and a branch and bound solution to the travelling salesman problem.


Naive SalesManProblem 
=====================
A Hamiltonian circuit can  be defined as a sequence of n + 1 adjacent vertices, that the first vertex  is  the last one and all the other n − 1 vertices are distinct. Also, we can suppose, with no loss of generality, that all circuit start and end at one special vertex . So, we can receive to all the tours by produce all the permutations of n − 1  cities,  compute the tour lengths, and find the shortest among them.
